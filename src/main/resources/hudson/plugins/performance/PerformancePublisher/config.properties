Threshold.Description=\
   Specify the error or performance regression threshold (percentage/ms), that can set the build state to unstable or \
   failed (a negative value means: unused threshold). Performance indicators are used with AND in between; between \
    Error and Performance indicators OR boolean condition is applied, to determine if the build is failed/unstable.\n\
    E.g. Errors count > 3 OR (Performance Regression > 15% AND Performance Regression Time > 2000ms) => Failed \n\
   This is with the intention to allow avoidance of small tests fluctuation (e.g. Unit Test timing increased from \
   running in 1ms to 2 ms is a regression of 100%, but not relevant for the performance of the application, as it \
   probably fluctuates with the machine load at the moment of run).
