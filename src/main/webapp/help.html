        This plugin understands the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">JMeter</a> analysis report XML
        format and the <a href="http://www.soapui.org/"> SOAPUI report in JUnit format</a>. <br/>
        This plug-in does not perform the actual analysis; it only displays useful information about analysis
        results, such as average responding time, historical result trend, web UI for viewing analysis reports,
        and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use this feature, first set up your build to run tests, then select the adequate parser for your
        tests (JMeter or JUnit) and finally you have to specify the path to the different performance XML files,
        by default the plugin will use the <tt>**/*.jtl</tt> pattern for JMeter, and <tt>**/TEST*.xml</tt>
        for JUnit tests.
    </p>

    <p>
        This plugin is capable to notify regression in performance (ms and percentage).
        For example you could configure a build to fail when: <br/>

        <tt>"Errors Count" > 3 OR ("Performance Regression" > 15% AND "Performance Regression Time" > 2000ms)</tt> <br/>

        <b>NOTE:</b> Between Error and Performance thresholds OR boolean condition is applied, while between the
        2 performance thresholds AND is applied. This happens, to allow avoidance of small test fluctuations: <br/>
        E.g. if a Unit Test run-time increased from 1ms to 2ms, this is a regression of 100%, but is not relevant
        for the performance of the application, as it probably fluctuates with the machine load at the moment of run;
        while for a test of 20 seconds, an increase of 15% in run time, should point a performance regression in
        the current implementation.
